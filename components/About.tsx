                Welcome to my corner of the digital world! üöÄ Passionate about
                software development, my year-long journey has focused on
                front-end technologies like WordPress, React, and the sleek
                styling of Tailwind CSS. With WordPress came in PHP as well.
                Beyond code, an early fascination with electronics and IT during
                teenage years led me to tinker with hardware, constructing and
                managing my own computers‚Äîa hobby turned lifelong interest. On
                the software side, I&apos;m in a perpetual state of learning.
                The love for efficiency led me to the world of data
                containerization, where Docker becomes the playground for
                streamlined development and deployment. When not immersed in the
                virtual realm, there&apos;s joy in the tangible experience of
                constructing and building. Proudly assembling my own server from
                scratch, finding joy in mastering the art of server management.
                Join this journey where technology meets creativity, and every
                code line is a step toward innovation! üåêüíª #TechEnthusiast
                #CodeArtisan <br></br> During no-computer time, leveraging
                Iceland&apos;s incredible environment and opportunities.
                I&apos;m a rock and ice climber (with a glacier guiding
                certificate), hiker, and a cyclist. Actively participating in
                volunteer work (like &apos;Hreinni Hornstrandir&apos;). I&apos;m
                also learning Icelandic language! More about my interests and
